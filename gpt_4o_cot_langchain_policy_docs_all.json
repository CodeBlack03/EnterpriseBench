Casual Leave: You have 8 days remaining out of your 12-day annual entitlement.\n2. Sick Leave: You have 2 days remaining out of your 10-day annual entitlement. You can combine this with casual leave if needed.\n3. Vacation Leave (Earned Leave): You have 9 days remaining. This accrues at 1 day per 20 days of service, with a maximum carryover of 30 days.\n\nOther leave types in the policy include:\n- Maternity Leave: 12 weeks for eligible female employees\n- Paternity Leave: 5 days for eligible male employees\n- Compensatory Leave: For work on holidays/weekends, to be taken within 30 days\n- Bereavement Leave: 5 days for immediate family members\n- Leave Without Pay: Available if you've exhausted paid leave options\n\nRemember, some leaves like sick leave require proper notification, and extended absences may need medical certificates. For any special circumstances or additional leave needs, you should consult with your manager and HR.",

Continuous Feedback (All Year): Expect regular informal and formal feedback from your manager. You'll have mandatory monthly 1:1 sessions, and there are real-time feedback tools in our HRMS you can use.\n\n3. Mid-Year Review (Q2/Q3: July): This is a formal checkpoint to assess your progress, identify any challenges, and adjust your objectives if needed.\n\n4. Annual Review (Q4: December): You'll have a comprehensive evaluation of your overall performance against your agreed-upon KPIs and competencies.\n\n5. Compensation & Development Decisions (Q1 of following year): The outcomes of your review will guide decisions about your salary adjustments, potential promotion, bonuses, and training plans.\n\nYour performance will be rated on a 5-point scale, from 1 (Unsatisfactory) to 5 (Outstanding). These ratings directly link to rewards - for example, a rating of 5 could lead to a salary adjustment of 15% or more, a high bonus, and high promotion eligibility.\n\nAs an employee, your responsibilities include setting realistic goals, maintaining performance logs, requesting feedback, self-assessing regularly, and actively participating in reviews.\n\nIf you receive a rating of 2 or 1, or show consistent underperformance over two quarters, you may be placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). This is a structured 30/60/90 day program to help you improve with specific objectives and support resources.\n\nRemember, this process is designed to foster your growth and recognize your contributions. Don't hesitate to engage actively in each stage and seek clarification from your manager or HR if you have any questions.",

You'd also be considered for leadership fast-track programs and mentorship roles.\n    - Rating 4 (Exceeds Expectations): You'd be eligible for a 10-15% salary adjustment, a medium bonus, medium promotion eligibility, and team recognition. You'd also be considered for an expanded role scope.\n\n    If you receive a low rating (1 or 2):\n    - Rating 2 (Needs Improvement): You'd receive a 0-3% salary adjustment, no bonus, and wouldn't be eligible for promotion. You might receive an improvement award if growth is shown. You'd be placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) with specific objectives, a 30/60/90 day timeline, and support resources.\n    - Rating 1 (Unsatisfactory): You'd receive no salary adjustment or bonus, wouldn't be eligible for promotion or recognition, and would be at risk of demotion. You'd be placed on a mandatory PIP, with potential outcomes including demotion, reassignment, or separation if improvement isn't achieved.\n\n    For both low ratings, the PIP process aims to help you improve your performance through specific objectives, timelines, and support resources. Successful completion allows you to return to normal duties, while partial improvement may result in an extended PIP.",

        "answer": "The company's policy on performance ratings outlines a clear connection between your rating and the rewards and recognition you receive. High performance ratings typically lead to greater rewards, such as bonuses, salary increases, and opportunities for recognition, including promotions or awards. Conversely, low performance ratings can have significant implications.\n\nIf you receive a low performance rating, the policy indicates that you may not be eligible for certain rewards, such as bonuses or salary increases. Additionally, low ratings could result in limited opportunities for recognition and career advancement. The policy also highlights that employees with low ratings may be subject to performance improvement plans, additional training, or closer supervision to address areas of concern. In some cases, persistent low performance could lead to more serious consequences, such as reassignment or termination, depending on the severity and duration of the performance issues.\n\nFor your specific case, Surya Reddy, with a performance rating of 4, this aligns with the company's framework for strong performance. A rating of 4 is typically associated with positive outcomes, including eligibility for rewards and recognition. However, if your concern is about receiving a low rating in the future, it\u2019s important to understand the outlined consequences and take proactive steps to maintain or improve your performance."

Password change requests were then validated against these requirements to identify any non-compliance. Next, the password management protocols were extracted, emphasizing secure storage in encrypted solutions and prohibiting transmission via unsecured platforms. The password reset process was verified to ensure adherence to these guidelines.

        "answer": "To ensure that password change requests comply with the 'Inazuma.co Password Policy Document' and are handled securely according to the outlined protocols, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Compliance Requirements**: Use tools like the policy_document_context_formatter to retrieve and format the 'Inazuma.co Password Policy Document' into a structured format. This will help identify specific compliance requirements and protocols for handling password change requests.\n\n2. **Identify Secure Handling Methods**: Based on the policy document, leverage IT Solutions to identify secure methods for handling password changes. Recommended methods include implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA), secure VPN configurations, and encrypted vaults for storing emergency access credentials.\n\n3. **Cross-Check Compliance**: Ensure that the identified secure handling methods align with the compliance protocols outlined in the policy document. This involves verifying that the methods meet the required standards for password complexity, change frequency, and secure storage.\n\n4. **Implement Secure Methods**: Use IT Solutions tools to implement the secure handling methods effectively. This includes setting up robust authentication mechanisms, monitoring access logs, conducting regular audits, and ensuring compliance with security policies. Additionally, establish workflows for prompt incident reporting and resolution to address vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Monitor and Validate Security**: Post-implementation, use monitoring and validation mechanisms to ensure ongoing security and compliance. This includes enforcing password complexity and change protocols, maintaining audit trails, integrating with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools to detect anomalies, and conducting regular security assessments. Providing security awareness training to employees further strengthens the process.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that password change requests are handled securely and in full compliance with the 'Inazuma.co Password Policy Document.'"
