You can combine this with casual leave if needed.\n3. Vacation Leave (Earned Leave): You have 9 days remaining. This accrues at 1 day per 20 days of service, with a maximum carryover of 30 days.\n\nOther leave types in the policy include:\n- Maternity Leave: 12 weeks for eligible female employees\n- Paternity Leave: 5 days for eligible male employees\n- Compensatory Leave: For work on holidays/weekends, to be taken within 30 days\n- Bereavement Leave: 5 days for immediate family members\n- Leave Without Pay: Available if you've exhausted paid leave options\n\nRemember, some leaves like sick leave require proper notification, and extended absences may need medical certificates. For any special circumstances or additional leave needs, you should consult with your manager and HR.",

Goal Setting (Q1: January-February): You'll collaborate with your manager to define your performance, behavioral, and development goals for the year.\n\n2. Continuous Feedback (All Year): Expect regular informal and formal feedback from your manager. You'll have mandatory monthly 1:1 sessions, and there are real-time feedback tools in our HRMS you can use.\n\n3. Mid-Year Review (Q2/Q3: July): This is a formal checkpoint to assess your progress, identify any challenges, and adjust your objectives if needed.\n\n4. Annual Review (Q4: December): You'll have a comprehensive evaluation of your overall performance against your agreed-upon KPIs and competencies.\n\n5. Compensation & Development Decisions (Q1 of following year): The outcomes of your review will guide decisions about your salary adjustments, potential promotion, bonuses, and training plans.\n\nYour performance will be rated on a 5-point scale, from 1 (Unsatisfactory) to 5 (Outstanding). These ratings directly link to rewards - for example, a rating of 5 could lead to a salary adjustment of 15% or more, a high bonus, and high promotion eligibility.\n\nAs an employee, your responsibilities include setting realistic goals, maintaining performance logs, requesting feedback, self-assessing regularly, and actively participating in reviews.\n\nIf you receive a rating of 2 or 1, or show consistent underperformance over two quarters, you may be placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). This is a structured 30/60/90 day program to help you improve with specific objectives and support resources.\n\nRemember, this process is designed to foster your growth and recognize your contributions. Don't hesitate to engage actively in each stage and seek clarification from your manager or HR if you have any questions.",

You'd also be considered for leadership fast-track programs and mentorship roles.\n    - Rating 4 (Exceeds Expectations): You'd be eligible for a 10-15% salary adjustment, a medium bonus, medium promotion eligibility, and team recognition. You'd also be considered for an expanded role scope.\n\n    If you receive a low rating (1 or 2):\n    - Rating 2 (Needs Improvement): You'd receive a 0-3% salary adjustment, no bonus, and wouldn't be eligible for promotion. You might receive an improvement award if growth is shown. You'd be placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) with specific objectives, a 30/60/90 day timeline, and support resources.\n    - Rating 1 (Unsatisfactory): You'd receive no salary adjustment or bonus, wouldn't be eligible for promotion or recognition, and would be at risk of demotion. You'd be placed on a mandatory PIP, with potential outcomes including demotion, reassignment, or separation if improvement isn't achieved.\n\n    For both low ratings, the PIP process aims to help you improve your performance through specific objectives, timelines, and support resources. Successful completion allows you to return to normal duties, while partial improvement may result in an extended PIP.",

This rating makes you eligible for rewards and recognition, highlighting your valuable contributions to the organization.\n\nIf you were to receive a low performance rating, such as a 2, the implications would be different. According to company policy, employees with low ratings are not eligible for rewards or recognition. Instead, they may be placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), which includes specific objectives for improvement, a timeline (e.g., 30/60/90 days), and support resources like training and mentorship. The outcomes of a PIP can vary, ranging from successful completion and a return to normal duties to more serious consequences like demotion, reassignment, or even separation if improvement is not achieved. Additionally, employees with low ratings are encouraged to focus on growth and development through structured plans.\n\nIn summary, your current strong performance rating positively impacts your rewards and recognition, while a low rating would shift the focus to improvement and addressing performance gaps."

Password change requests were then validated against these requirements to identify any non-compliance. Next, the password management protocols were extracted, emphasizing secure storage in encrypted solutions and prohibiting transmission via unsecured platforms. The password reset process was verified to ensure adherence to these guidelines. Finally, examples of strong passwords and compliant suggestions were provided to assist users during the reset process. This comprehensive approach ensures compliance with the policy and secure handling of password changes.",

This document outlines the specific protocols and compliance requirements for password management.\n\n2. **Format and Extract Key Requirements**: Utilize the policy_document_context_formatter tool to format the retrieved document and extract critical protocols. This step ensures clarity on the requirements for secure handling of password change requests.\n\n3. **Verify Employee Context**: Use the get_emp_context tool to retrieve the employee context for the individual requesting the password change (e.g., Matthew Brooks, emp_id: emp_1106). This step ensures that the request aligns with the employee's role, access level, and organizational policies.\n\n4. **Cross-Check Compliance**: Cross-check the employee's context with the password policy requirements using the IT Solutions app. This ensures that the employee meets the necessary criteria for secure password change handling.\n\n5. **Generate a Secure Workflow**: Based on the formatted password policy document and verified employee context, use the IT Solutions app to create a secure workflow for processing password change requests. This workflow should incorporate all compliance and security measures outlined in the policy.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that all password change requests are processed securely and in full compliance with the 'Inazuma.co Password Policy Document.'"
